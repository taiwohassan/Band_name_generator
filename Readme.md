# **Day One of 100 days of Python Project: Band Name Generator**

## **Project Description**
The **Band Name Generator** is a fun and interactive Python program that helps users come up with a creative band name. The program asks users two simple questions about their personal experiences and combines their answers to generate a unique band name.

## **How It Works**
1. The program welcomes the user with a greeting message.
2. It asks the user to input:
   - The name of the city they grew up in.
   - The name of their pet (or any name they'd like to use).
3. It then combines the two inputs to suggest a potential band name.

## **Code**
```python
print("Welcome to the Band Name Generator.")
city = input("What's the name of the city you grew up in?\n")
pet_name = input("What's your pet's name?\n")
print(f"Your band name could be {city} {pet_name}")
```

## **Usage**
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Run the script in your Python environment:
   ```bash
   python band_name_generator.py
   ```
3. Answer the prompts, and your band name will be generated instantly!

## **Example**
**Input:**
```
What's the name of the city you grew up in?  
Lagos  
What's your pet's name?  
Bingo
```

**Output:**
```
Your band name could be Lagos Bingo
```

## **Skills Learned**
- Using `print` to display messages.
- Taking user input with the `input()` function.
- Combining strings to form creative outputs.

## **Project Goal**
This project is designed for beginners to get comfortable with basic Python concepts such as:
- Printing messages.
- Reading user input.
- String concatenation.

## **Future Improvements**
- Add more questions to make the band name generation more dynamic.
- Save generated band names to a file for users to revisit.
- Create a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more interactive experience.

Enjoy generating creative band names! ðŸš€
